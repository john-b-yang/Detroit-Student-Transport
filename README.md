MHacks 8 Project

Detroit School Transit (DST) enables students to take control of their transit schedule. By turning on location tracking 
during their commute, a transit report is generated to vouch for students who waited at bus stops for late arrivals. DST 
further enables parents to track their childrenâ€™s location side-by-side with real-time bus arrival and departure info. Parents 
can also track the commute and know when their children get to school safely. There is an additional web-based administrative 
platform to view student transit reports.
